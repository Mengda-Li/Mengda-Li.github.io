I was born in [Nanyang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanyang,_Henan){:target="\_blank"}, a city in the landlocked province [Henan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henan){:target="\_blank"} of China. Afterward, I completed my undergraduate studies at [Sorbonne University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorbonne_University){:target="\_blank"} in Paris and a [master's in Machine Learning (MVA)](https://www.master-mva.com/){:target="\_blank"} at [ENS Paris-Saclay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_normale_sup%C3%A9rieure_Paris-Saclay){:target="\_blank"}.
