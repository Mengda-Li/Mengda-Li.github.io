My research interests include finance and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Predicting market impact of news is my Phd study subject.

Before, I worked with [Charles-Albert Lehalle](https://lehalle.net/){:target="\_blank"} in [Capital Fund Management](https://www.cfm.fr/){:target="\_blank"} during my master internship.


Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
